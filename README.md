# hello-world
===============

Clap your hands everybody, and everybody clap your hands!
We're Lambda Lambda Lambda and... Omega Mu 
We come here on stage tonight to do a show for you 
We've got a rockin rhythm and a high tech sound 
That'll make you move your body down to the ground 
We've got Poindexter on the violin 
And Louis and Gilbert will be joinin' in 
We've got Booger Presley on a mean guitar 
And a rap by little old me Lamar 
We've got Takashi beating on his gong 
The boys and the Mu's are clapping along 
And just when you thought you'd seen it all 
Along comes a Lambda 4 ft tall!
So won't you come on out here, on the floor,
so we can work our bodies like never before
Break!
